Starting from the bottom

Hey my name is Larry. I graduated with a degree in mechanical engineering but did almost no programming! I didn't have the greatest experience my freshman year so I did what I could to avoid it. I'm now graduated, but have found interest in learning Java in my free time now that I can learn at my own pace.
